Summary:  This script can be used with future elections by changing the database file that the election results were on.  The only part of the code that will need to be changed is the .csv file that was where the votes were organized.  Overall, this is a good code for performing concise data for performing election results.  Not only to determine the winner which is important, but also to determine where advertising and education should be in order to improve the county turnout for elections.
